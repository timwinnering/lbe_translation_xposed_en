lbe_translation_xposed_en
=========================
Translates LBE Security Master 5.1.xxxx (including Privacy Space and Antitheft) into English.

Source is on github

Tested with LBE 5.1.4722 thru 5.1.5446 ...

Benefits ?
You can run the ORIGINAL, UNMODIFIED apk
You can Update from within LBE - and even install Privacy Space / Antitheft from within LBE
If new versions of LBE are released, chances are pretty good that most of it will still be translated, so no waiting for anyone to unpack the apk.
LBE crashes or behaves strangely ? Just disable the Xposed Module and reboot ...

Risks/Downside ?
Fresh versions of LBE may potentially show some parts in Chinese or could crash.
Startup Images are not (cannot?) be translated, these are only shown right after Install. Simply swipe over them.
